# Branch Management System - React Application
![Uploading image.pngâ€¦]()

This project is a React-based web application designed for efficient management of branch information. It provides a user-friendly interface to view, add, edit, delete, export, and filter branch data. The application leverages Material UI components for a modern and responsive design, and integrates with external libraries for data export functionalities.

## Features

*   **Data Grid Display:** Branch data is displayed in a sortable and paginated table using the Material UI `DataGrid` component. This allows for easy navigation and management of large datasets.
*   **Add Branch:** A modal form allows users to add new branch information, including details like branch name, short name, locality, city, state, contact person, contact number, PAN, GSTIN, and status.
*   **Edit Branch:** Users can directly edit branch information within the data grid. Changes are saved and updated in real-time.
*   **Delete Branch:** Users can select one or more branches and delete them with a single click.
*   **Data Export:**
    *   **Excel Export:** Data can be exported to an Excel (.xlsx) file using the `xlsx` library.
    *   **PDF Export:** Data can be exported to a PDF file using the `jspdf` and `jspdf-autotable` libraries.
*   **Filtering and Searching:** The `DataGrid` provides built-in filtering capabilities, allowing users to filter data based on specific criteria. A quick filter is also available for searching across all columns.
*   **Fullscreen Mode:** A fullscreen button allows users to toggle the application into fullscreen mode for an immersive experience.
*   **Responsive Design:** The application is built with Material UI, ensuring a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
*   **Modern UI:** The application uses Material UI components for a clean and modern user interface.

## Technologies Used

*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **Material UI:** A popular React UI framework providing pre-built components and styling.
*   **@mui/x-data-grid:** A powerful data grid component from Material UI for displaying and managing tabular data.
*   **xlsx:** A library for reading and writing Excel files.
*   **jspdf:** A library for generating PDF documents.
*   **jspdf-autotable:** An extension for `jspdf` that simplifies the creation of tables in PDF documents.
